# Numeric ID Assigner #

This is a simple utility that assigns sequential, unique identifiers to items. It can be used to map longer identifiers, like names (`std::string`), GUIDs, long, meaningless numbers (like `std::thread::id`), to much shorter ones. The input and output types are template parameters.
